make another class for a border
.thick-green-border{
    border-color:green;
    border-width:10px;
    border-style:solid;
    border-radius:10px;     <!-- for rounded corners -->
  }

when you now use <img .......> in this you have to call two functions one of image size and other of border then you will use this
<img class= "class1 class2>......>
like
<img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. ">
